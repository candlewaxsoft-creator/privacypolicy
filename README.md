## Privacy Policy for Candlewax

**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

### 1. Overview

Candlewax ("we," "our," or "the extension") is a productivity tool designed to help users download their own call transcripts and summaries from the Gong platform. We are committed to your privacy and follow a "Privacy by Design" approach, ensuring that your data remains under your control.

### 2. Information Collection and Use

Candlewax processes the following types of data:

* **Web Content:** The extension scrapes call transcripts, participant names, dates, and summaries directly from the `app.gong.io` pages you visit.
* **Purpose:** This data is collected for the **sole purpose** of generating local `.txt` and `.csv` files for your personal use.

### 3. Local Processing (Zero Data Transmission)

Your privacy is protected by the technical architecture of the extension:

* **No Remote Servers:** All data extraction and file formatting occur **locally** within your browser.
* **No Data Storage:** We do not store your transcripts on any external database. Once the download is complete or the browser session ends, the extracted data is cleared from the extension's temporary memory.
* **No Tracking:** We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics to monitor your activity or usage habits.

### 4. Permissions Disclosure

To function, Candlewax requires the following permissions:

* **`scripting` & `host_permissions`:** To read and parse transcript text from the Gong interface.
* **`downloads`:** To save the generated files to your local "Downloads" folder.
* **`storage`:** To remember your session status (e.g., if a bulk download is paused).

### 5. Third-Party Sharing

We **never** sell, trade, or transmit your data to third parties. Because we do not collect your data on our servers, it is technically impossible for us to share it with advertisers or data brokers.

### 6. Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including requirements for **Limited Use** and **Scraping Disclosure**.
